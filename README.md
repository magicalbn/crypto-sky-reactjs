This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Note
1. I have refactored the exercise from NextJS to ReactJS as per instructions.
2. The website functions as a Single Page Application
3. Bittrex API has a no-CORS policy for client side so added a server side with expressJS to connect to API.
4. Server and client side will run simultaneously on different ports.
5. Client and Server both needs to be running for the app to work.

## Instructions to run
### node modules installation
1. To install client side node module kindly run.  `npm i`
2. To install server side node module kindly run.  `npm i --prefix server`
